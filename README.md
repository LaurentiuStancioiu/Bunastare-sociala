# TravelPlannerAI

TravelPlannerAI leverages a robust tech stack to provide users with a seamless and comprehensive travel planning experience. Our technology infrastructure incorporates cutting-edge tools and APIs to deliver real-time information and intelligent responses.

## Technologies Used:

### 1. Amadeus for Developers
[Amadeus for Developers](https://developers.amadeus.com/) is a crucial component of our tech stack, enabling us to access real-time travel-related data. This includes information on flights, hotels, and points of interest near the destination city. Amadeus for Developers empowers TravelPlannerAI to offer up-to-date and accurate details for a user's travel itinerary.

### 2. OpenAI GPT-4-turbo
[OpenAI GPT-4-turbo](https://openai.com/) serves as the backbone of our language processing capabilities. Recognized as state-of-the-art (SOTA) for language tasks, this model is integrated for its advanced language understanding and its convenient built-in function calling. It plays a central role in understanding user queries and generating relevant responses.

### 3. LangChain
LangChain acts as the intermediary between the user interface and the various tools integrated into TravelPlannerAI. This component is responsible for processing user inputs, connecting with the OpenAI model, and facilitating communication with other external services. LangChain serves as the glue that seamlessly binds together our functions and the Language Model (LLM).

### 4. Open Meteo API
[Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) is utilized to fetch real-time weather information. By integrating this API, TravelPlannerAI ensures that users have access to the latest weather updates for their chosen destinations, allowing for informed travel decisions.

### 5. Wikipedia API
The [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) is employed to gather comprehensive general information about the places users intend to visit. This ensures that TravelPlannerAI not only provides practical details but also enriches the user experience with relevant background information.

## Conclusion

With a powerful combination of Amadeus for Developers, OpenAI GPT-4-turbo, LangChain, Open Meteo API, and Wikipedia API, TravelPlannerAI offers a sophisticated and intelligent travel planning solution. This tech stack enables us to deliver a user-friendly interface while harnessing the capabilities of state-of-the-art technologies for a seamless and enriched travel experience.

# TravelPlannerAI

TravelPlannerAI leverages a robust tech stack to provide users with a seamless and comprehensive travel planning experience. Our technology infrastructure incorporates cutting-edge tools and APIs to deliver real-time information and intelligent responses.

## Technologies Used:

### 1. Amadeus for Developers
[Amadeus for Developers](https://developers.amadeus.com/) is a crucial component of our tech stack, enabling us to access real-time travel-related data. This includes information on flights, hotels, and points of interest near the destination city. Amadeus for Developers empowers TravelPlannerAI to offer up-to-date and accurate details for a user's travel itinerary.

### 2. OpenAI GPT-4-turbo

Recognized as state-of-the-art (SOTA) for language tasks, this model is integrated for its advanced language understanding and its convenient built-in function calling. It plays a central role in understanding user queries and generating relevant responses. Also, with the Assistants API, we keep track of our user responses while enabeling features such as Code Interpreter, retrieval and more.

### 3. Solara
[Solara](https://solara.dev/api) is our framework to build frontend from our app within our python backhand. We chose it because it has high reactivity and a clear logic for creating pages chat interfaces and even maps.

### 4. Open Meteo API
[Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) is utilized to fetch real-time weather information. By integrating this API, TravelPlannerAI ensures that users have access to the latest weather updates for their chosen destinations, allowing for informed travel decisions.

### 5. Wikipedia API
The [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) is employed to gather comprehensive general information about the places users intend to visit. This ensures that TravelPlannerAI not only provides practical details but also enriches the user experience with relevant background information.
